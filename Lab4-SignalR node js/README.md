# signalr-client-nodejs

This is a signalR client for node.js.

The only communication channel that is supported is websockets. This will not
fallback to long polling or any other protocol.

Make sure your hub is configured to support websockets.

This is a node.js service client. It is not supported within a web browser.  
For browser support use the offical client from Microsoft.
