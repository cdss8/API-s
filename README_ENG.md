**# API-s
Creating different types of interfaces (Node js)

#laboratory 1
He has two different labs
 Node Express (folder): Creation of Full REST-API with Node js(Express js) and MongooDB. GET-Created Successfully, POST-Created Successfully but data is not saved to Moongoose (mongoDB) because Atlas doesn't work in Russia and rejects any data coming from my IP (Redis does the same). It does not allow saving data from POSTMAN to MongoDB, and therefore I cannot modify (UPDATE) or delete (DELETE) it, since the data was not saved.
 
 That's why he decides to create the following mini API with fullstack
 Node Express Vue (Folder): Complete REST API creation with vue js framework (for frontend) and Fetch file handling. As layout, it used the official Bootstrap5.3 layout.
 
 
 #lab 2
An application that allows the creation of different pages integrated with the SOAP client without having to use any of the SOAP web services such as SoapUI or others.
The algorithm is written to give concrete instructions, to change results of that API, we would have to introduce different characteristics of the web services of the SOAP websites introduced in the pcode


 
 #lab 3 
 Working with the creation of the gRPC API, it was decided to use PS'SQL DataBase to save, modify and delete my data (since no frontend was implemented).
 The relational database (PsSQL) is read correctly and so is the GET method. The other methods do not work very well since my database is relational and I have to work with it in a unique way. unlike non-relational database (NoSQL)
 
  
  
  #lab 4 (Modify)
  Signal R client with Websockets. The only communication channel that is supported is websockets (Perhaps because it only supports ASP.NET? https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/aspnet/signalr/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-signalr).**
